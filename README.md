⭐ Love for Spotify ⭐ <br> </br>
This is really a tribute to the Spotify API. I absolutely love how Spotify makes yearly wraps for every user and I wanted to make something of my own! Combining my passion for frontend and graphic design, I created and designed a newspaper displaying a user's top songs.
