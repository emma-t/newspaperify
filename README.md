# üßê Background

**‚≠ê Love for Spotify**
This is really a tribute to the Spotify API. I absolutely love how Spotify makes yearly wraps for every user and I wanted to make something of my own! Combining my passion for frontend and graphic design, I created and designed a newspaper displaying a user's top songs.

# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the 007Secure uses:

- This project uses CSS, HTML, and JS and is deployed on the github-pages environment
- The base of the site uses a Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/naemazam/pen/rNrqeZB](https://codepen.io/naemazam/pen/rNrqeZB)
- The name 007Secure refers to how the website theme resembles that of being a spy, like James Bond. Everyone's security is important and it is our **mission** to teach as many people as we can
